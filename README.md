# ForbesScrapy
Crawling Top 800 Best Employers Data from Forbes.com using Scrapy.

## Introduction
Details about the all 800 entries present in [World's Best Employers](https://www.forbes.com/lists/worlds-best-employers/?sh=5dc799fd1e0c) Data hosted by Forbes was crawled using [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/), sorted out rank wise and then stored in a json file named  **forbes1.json**

The same spider is then used to crawl relevant data of top 20 companies by rank through their profile links fetched from the original list. Result is again stored in another json file named **company.json** (Just with a different parser function this time)

Spider is named **spider1.py** in the spiders folder.

To simply crawl data at once, run the following command in terminal by going in your parent folder directory first:
```sh
scrapy crawl spider1
```

Data will be stored in the parent folder.
